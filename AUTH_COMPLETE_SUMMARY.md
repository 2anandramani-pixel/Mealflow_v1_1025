## 🔐 How Authentication Works

### Signup Process:
1. User enters email/password
2. Validates:
   - Email format
   - Password ≥ 8 characters
   - Passwords match
   - Terms agreed
3. Stores account in `localStorage`:
   ```json
   {
     "email": "user@example.com",
     "createdAt": "2024-10-22T..."
   }
   ```
4. Proceeds to household setup

### Login Process:
1. User enters email/password
2. Checks `localStorage` for account
3. If found and email matches:
   - ✅ Check for saved profiles
   - ✅ Check for household data
   - ✅ Route appropriately
4. If not found or wrong email:
   - ❌ Show error message
   - Link to signup

---

## 📱 Mobile Responsive

Both flows work perfectly on:
- ✅ Desktop (full modal)
- ✅ Tablet (responsive sizing)
- ✅ Mobile (touch-optimized)

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

### Current Implementation (LocalStorage):
- ⚠️ **For demo purposes only**
- Email stored in plain text
- Password NOT stored (good!)
- Ready for backend integration

### Production Ready (Backend Needed):
```javascript
// Replace with API calls:
const response = await fetch('/api/auth/signup', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ email, password })
});

const response = await fetch('/api/auth/login', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ email, password })
});
```

### Backend Should Handle:
- Password hashing (bcrypt)
- Session tokens (JWT)
- Email verification
- Password reset
- Rate limiting
- Account lockout

---

## 📊 What's Stored

### After Signup:
```javascript
localStorage['mealflow_account'] = {
  email: "user@email.com",
  createdAt: "2024-10-22..."
}
```

### After Household Setup:
```javascript
localStorage['mealflow_household'] = { ... }
localStorage['mealflow_members'] = [ ... ]
```

### After Saving Profile:
```javascript
localStorage['mealflow_family_profiles'] = {
  "Profile Name": { household, members, savedAt }
}
```

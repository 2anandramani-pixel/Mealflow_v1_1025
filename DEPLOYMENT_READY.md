# 🚀 MealFlow Deployment Ready!

## ✅ What Was Completed

### 1. Fixed GitHub Pages Deployment Issue
**Problem Found:** Absolute paths in `manifest.json` and `service-worker.js` wouldn't work on GitHub Pages subdirectory deployment.

**Solution Applied:**
- ✅ Changed `/app.html` → `./app.html` in manifest.json
- ✅ Changed all `/file.js` → `./file.js` in service-worker.js
- ✅ Added missing `app.js` to cache list
- ✅ Committed changes locally (commit: `fac0bf0`)

### 2. Created Testing Documentation
- ✅ **DEPLOYMENT_TEST_GUIDE.md** - Comprehensive testing guide (300+ lines)
- ✅ **QUICK_TEST_CHECKLIST.md** - Quick 10-minute test plan

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Design Patterns Used
- **Singleton Pattern**: Storage manager, calculator instances
- **Module Pattern**: ES6 classes for encapsulation
- **MVC-like Structure**: Separation of data, logic, and UI
- **Observer Pattern**: Event-based UI updates

### Data Flow
```
User Input ‚Üí Validation ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí State Update ‚Üí UI Render
```

### State Management
- Centralized in `AppState` class
- LocalStorage as persistence layer
- No external dependencies

# 🎯 MealFlow - Your Next Steps

## ✅ What I Just Completed

### 1. Fixed GitHub Pages Deployment Bug
- **Issue**: Absolute paths (`/app.html`) don't work on GitHub Pages subdirectories
- **Fix**: Changed to relative paths (`./app.html`) in:
  - `manifest.json`
  - `service-worker.js`
- **Also**: Added missing `app.js` to service worker cache

### 2. Created Testing Documentation
- **DEPLOYMENT_READY.md** - Quick overview & next steps (you're reading it!)
- **QUICK_TEST_CHECKLIST.md** - 10-minute test plan
- **DEPLOYMENT_TEST_GUIDE.md** - Comprehensive testing guide

### 3. Committed Everything
```
316e508 - Add comprehensive deployment and testing documentation
fac0bf0 - Fix GitHub Pages deployment: Update paths to be relative
```

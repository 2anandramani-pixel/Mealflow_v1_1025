## üé® Customization Tips

### Add Your Own Recipes
Edit `recipes.js` and add to the `RECIPES_DB` array. Include:
- Complete nutritional info per ingredient
- Accurate serving sizes
- Relevant tags for filtering

### Adjust Macro Ratios
Edit `macros.js` ‚Üí `MACRO_SPLITS` object to add custom ratios

### Change Meal Calorie Distribution
Edit `meal-planner.js` ‚Üí `MEAL_CALORIE_SPLIT` object:
- Default: 25% breakfast, 35% lunch, 30% dinner, 10% snack

## ü§ù Next Steps

1. Test the core flow end-to-end
2. Add more recipes to `recipes.js`
3. Customize for your actual family
4. Consider adding features from the roadmap
5. Deploy to a hosting service (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages)
